# Python Exercise Scripts

This directory contains Python script versions of the IT Security exercises. These are plain Python files that will definitely work without any compatibility issues.

## 🎯 Exercise Files

### Sheet 1: Arithmetic & Affine Cipher
**File:** `sheet1_arithmetic_affine.py`

**Topics Covered:**
- Modular arithmetic and multiplicative inverses
- Trial method vs Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- Affine cipher implementation and cryptanalysis
- Frequency analysis attacks

**How to Use:**
```bash
cd exercises
python3 sheet1_arithmetic_affine.py
```

### Sheet 3: Block Cipher Operating Modes  
**File:** `sheet3_operating_modes.py`

**Topics Covered:**
- AES-ECB and AES-CBC implementations
- Security analysis of different modes
- Meet-in-the-middle attack concepts
- Padding oracle vulnerabilities

**How to Use:**
```bash
cd exercises
python3 sheet3_operating_modes.py
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

2. **Run an Exercise:**
   ```bash
   python3 exercises/sheet1_arithmetic_affine.py
   ```

3. **Work Through TODOs:**
   - Each file contains numbered TODOs
   - Uncomment function calls as you complete exercises
   - Test your implementations step by step

## 📚 Learning Approach

### Progressive Learning
1. **Read the theory** in comments and docstrings
2. **Complete the TODOs** step by step
3. **Test your implementations** with provided test functions
4. **Uncomment the next exercise** and continue

### Example Workflow
```python
# Start with Exercise 1
exercise_1_manual_calculations()

# Complete the TODOs in find_inverse_trial()
# Then uncomment:
# test_trial_method()

# Continue to next exercise...
```

## 🎯 Advantages of Script Format

- ✅ **No compatibility issues** - works everywhere Python works
- ✅ **Easy to run** - just `python3 filename.py`
- ✅ **Great for learning** - step through code line by line
- ✅ **Debugger friendly** - set breakpoints, inspect variables
- ✅ **Version control friendly** - clean diffs, easy collaboration

## 🔧 Tips for Success

1. **Read before coding** - understand the theory first
2. **Test frequently** - run tests after each TODO completion
3. **Use a debugger** - step through algorithms to understand them
4. **Experiment** - modify parameters and see what happens
5. **Take notes** - document your learning and insights

## 🤝 Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Read the hints in TODO comments
2. Check the docstrings for algorithm outlines
3. Review the theory sections
4. Try the simpler exercises first to build confidence

Happy learning! 🎓
